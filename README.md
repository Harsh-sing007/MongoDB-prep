# MongoDB-prep 📚🍃

This repository is created to **track my MongoDB learning journey**.

The sole purpose of this repo is to document whatever I learn and practice related to **MongoDB**, including commands, queries, and small code snippets. It acts as my **personal notes + revision space**.

## 📌 What this repository contains

- MongoDB shell (**mongosh**) commands  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Query operators (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$and`, `$or`, etc.)
- Update operators (`$set`, `$inc`, `$unset`, etc.)
- Practice queries used during learning
- Experimentation and trial commands

Most of the content will be **raw commands and code**, pushed regularly as I learn.
